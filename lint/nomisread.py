"""no-misread: find and remove the marks that make English read as machine-written.

Two jobs, two modes.

  --strip   Rewrite the text with the machine marks taken out: invisible
            characters, and the typography no one types by hand. Safe to run
            on anything. It changes characters, never words.

  --check   Score the text. Reports the tells it can count, plus a rhythm
            measurement that no vocabulary list can catch: human sentence
            length swings, machine sentence length does not.

Ceiling, stated up front: this is a regex pass, not a parser. It cannot see
part of speech, so "that lead" and "to lead" look alike to it. It flags
passive voice only in its common forms. A zero score means the text is clean
of the things this file knows about, not that a person wrote it. Read the
prose yourself before you believe any number here.

Usage:
  python3 nomisread.py --check  draft.md
  python3 nomisread.py --strip  draft.md > clean.md
  cat draft.md | python3 nomisread.py --check -
  python3 nomisread.py --self-test

Exit codes for --check: 0 clean, 1 tells found.
